# Quesiton 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
totalaisle =instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  distinct()
 
mostaisle=instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())%>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

  mostaisle
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                          count
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

### Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  filter(count > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = count, y = aisle, fill = aisle),stat = 'identity') +
  labs(title = "Aisles and number of ordered ",x = "number of item", y = "Aisle name",) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none',axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7))
```

### Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
rbind(
  bakingingredients=instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients") %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  head(3),
  
  dogfoodcare=instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == "dog food care") %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  head(3),
  
  packagedvegetablesfruits=instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  head(3)
  )%>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
mean = instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples" ,"Coffee Ice Cream"))%>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(meanhour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = order_dow, values_from = meanhour)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
mean=mutate(
  rename(mean,"Sun" = "0","Mon" = "1","Tue" = "2","Wed" = "3","Thur" = "4","Fri" = "5","Sat" = "6"))

mean %>% knitr::kable()
```

| product\_name    |      Sun |      Mon |      Tue |      Wed |     Thur |      Fri |      Sat |

# Quesiton 2

``` r
data(nyc_airbnb)
data(rest_inspec)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

### format the data to use appropriate variable names/focus on the “Overall Health” topic/include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”/organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

``` r
BRFSS = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  filter(topic %in% "Overall Health",response %in% c("Poor", "Fair", 'Good', 'Very good',"Excellent"))%>%
  mutate(response = forcats::fct_relevel(response,c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))
```

### In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?

``` r
BRFSS %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr)%>% 
  summarise(countnumnber = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>% 
  filter(countnumnber >= 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| locationabbr | countnumnber |
|:-------------|-------------:|
| CT           |            7 |
| FL           |            7 |
| MA           |            8 |
| NC           |            7 |
| NJ           |            8 |
| PA           |           10 |

``` r
BRFSS %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr)%>% 
  summarise(countnumnber = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>% 
  filter(countnumnber >= 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| locationabbr | countnumnber |
|:-------------|-------------:|
| CA           |           12 |
| CO           |            7 |
| FL           |           41 |
| MA           |            9 |
| MD           |           12 |
| NC           |           12 |
| NE           |           10 |
| NJ           |           19 |
| NY           |            9 |
| OH           |            8 |
| PA           |            7 |
| SC           |            7 |
| TX           |           16 |
| WA           |           10 |

### Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic will help).

``` r
BRFSS%>%
  filter(response == c('Excellent'))%>%
  group_by(locationabbr,year)%>%
  summarise(mean = mean(data_value))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean,color = locationabbr)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'locationabbr'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

    ## Warning: Removed 4 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

    ## Warning: Removed 3 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path).

### Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010, distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State.

``` r
BRFSS %>% 
  filter(locationabbr ==  c("NY"),year == c(2006,2010))%>% 
  select(year,response,data_value)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
```

    ## Warning in year == c(2006, 2010): longer object length is not a multiple of
    ## shorter object length
